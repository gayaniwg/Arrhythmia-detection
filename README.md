Developed an Arrhythmia-detection system by implementing three models: DecisionTreeClassifier, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and LSTM. After conducting thorough statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data preprocessing, the LSTM model emerged as the best performer with a final accuracy of 0.98. This project demonstrated a strong understanding of machine learning techniques and their application in medical diagnostics.
